#Application Starter Tremens

##Application Starter Tremens
Welcome to the AST project. This little application was written to simplify my existence at work where i every day (and sometimes several times a day) need to start the same applications. Until now i have used an elisp script to do the job but since i was now in need to change stuff around this was a more simple and fun way of doing it.

Since codeplex has been shut down i have forked this project and moved it to GitHub since i still need this app from time to time. ClickOnce deployment and automatic updates have been diabled.
